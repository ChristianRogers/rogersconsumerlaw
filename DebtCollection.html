          <h3>Debt Relief and Negotiation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Do you need somebody to dispute or negotiate your debt?</li>
            <li>Do you dispute owing the debt?</li>
            <li>
              Do you need help trying to negotiate a resolution or a settlement?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you have large debt you need assistance either negotiating or
              trying to defend against?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our office has negotiated for reduced settlements on numerous
            occasions; it’s a regular part of our business. Many of our clients
            have been spared a Bankruptcy through our Debt Negotiation Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            If our Debt Negotiation Services are unsuccessful, however, we
            typically offer a partial credit of fees paid towards our Bankruptcy
            Assistance fees. We really do care!!!

          <h3>Abusive Collection Agencies</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>1.</strong> Often debt collectors purchase names of
            "debtors" in lists of thousands of people. These are not the
            original corporations or people to whom you owed money, so often
            they don't have the documentation and proof of your debt.<br />
            <em
              >What We Can Do: We can often get the entire debt dropped if there
              is no documentation, or at least get the debt negotiated down.</em
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>2.</strong> Sometimes debt collectors accuse you of debts
            you never owed, or debts that are way beyond what you owed.<br />
            <em
              >What We Can Do: We can negotiate the debt down or get the entire
              debt dropped.</em
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>3.</strong> Debt Collectors violating the Fair Debt
            Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. § 1692.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Collection Agencies and Collection Attorneys who are not the
              original creditors and who have taken assignment after an alleged
              default have limitations on how they can collect against you.
            </li>
            <li>
              These Debt Collectors must cease communication when properly
              requested and are prohibited from harassing, oppressing, or
              abusing any person in connection with the collection of a debt.
            </li>
            <li>
              These Debt Collectors are prohibited from using any false or
              misleading representation or unfair means to attempt to collect
              any debt.
            </li>

          <p>
            A decision to file for bankruptcy should be made only after
            determining that bankruptcy is the best way to deal with your
            financial problems.

              Stop foreclosure on your house or mobile home and allow you an

            </li>
            <li>
              Prevent repossession of a car or other property, or force the
              creditor to return property even after it has been repossessed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stop wage garnishment, debt collection harassment, and similar

            <strong>Property You Are Allowed to Keep (Utah Exemptions)</strong>
            <p>
              In a Chapter 7 case, you can keep property which the law says is
              "exempt." Utah limits you to state exemptions in most cases. Some
              of these include:
            </p>
            <ul class="exemptions-list">
              <li>
                A Homestead Exemption up to $41,000 (couples may double this).

              <li>1 motor vehicle up to $3,000.</li>
              <li>

              <li>
                Household furnishings, dining tables, and chairs up to $1,000.

              <li>Animals, books, and musical instruments up to $1,000.</li>
              <li>Heirlooms and sentimental items up to $1,000.</li>
