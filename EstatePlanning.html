          <h3>What is Estate Planning?</h3>
          <p>
            Your <span style="font-style: italic">estate</span> is, basically,
            everything you own. At some point, everyone is going to die and
            estate planning is simply preparing in advance of your death for
            dealing with your assets, your liabilities, and any taxes which may
            be associated with the transference of your estate.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Identify</span> in writing, all
              assets, including life insurance proceeds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Determine</span> what you want
              done with your assets at your death.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Evaluate</span> which estate
              planning tools will best suit your wishes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Enact</span> the estate plan and
              ensure that all needed action is taken.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            A careful estate plan is drafted with both the expected and
            unexpected in mind.

          <h3>Wills & Trusts</h3>
          <p>
            A <span style="font-style: italic">will</span> is a written document
            with important legal relevance. A proper will permits you to
            identify who will receive part of your estate, identify your
            intended personal representative, and nominate a guardian for your
            minor children. If you die without a will, the State of Utah has
            drafted one for you. This is called an
            <span style="font-style: italic">Intestacy Statute</span> and
            determines how the State thinks your assets should be distributed.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <span style="font-style: italic">trust</span> is an entity
            recognized by Utah law to hold and manage assets. There are multiple
            benefits that trusts can offer: privacy, avoiding probate, providing
            for incapacity, and safeguarding assets. Trusts can be used for
            almost anyone, however, they simply may be more horsepower than you
            need your engine to have.

          <h3>Probate & Powers of Attorney</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="font-style: italic">Probate</span> is the process of
            administering the estate of a deceased person. Formal probate is not
            necessarily a difficult or expensive process. It can have several
            benefits including providing a cutoff date for creditors to make
            claims and providing clear title to property.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <span style="font-style: italic">power of attorney</span> is a
            written document in which you authorize another to make certain
            decisions for you. A
            <span style="font-style: italic">Durable POA</span> takes effect
            immediately upon signing. A
            <span style="font-style: italic">Springing POA</span> generally
            takes effect or springs into effect upon the incapacity of the
            person.

            essentially combines the powers of a healthcare power of attorney
            with a living will by allowing you to plan for medical incapacity.

          <h3>Common Terminology</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Intestate:</span> If you die without
            a will, you are considered to have died intestate. <br /><br />
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Codicil:</span> A document modifying
            a will. <br /><br />
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Holographic Will:</span> Any
            document entirely in your own handwriting, signed and dated by you.
            <br /><br />
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Self-Proved Will:</span> A will
            which has been signed and notarized in accordance with Utah law; it
            doesn't need a witness to prove its authenticity in court.
            <br /><br />
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Settlor & Trustee:</span> The person
            creating the trust is called the settlor and the person managing the
            trust is called a trustee. <br /><br />

              >Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship:</span
            >
            The decedent's interest in the property is transferred to the other

            outside of the will.
