          <h3>Common Dealer Scams</h3>
          <p>
            Buying a car is one of the largest purchases most people make.
            Unfortunately, some dealerships engage in deceptive practices that
            can leave you with a defective vehicle or a loan you didn't agree
            to.
          </p>
          <p>
            We help consumers challenge deceptive dealership tactics, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>"Yo-Yo" Financing:</strong> Claiming financing fell
              through days later and forcing you to sign a new contract at a
              higher rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Title Issues:</strong> Failure to deliver title/plates or
              selling a vehicle with an undisclosed "Salvage" or "Branded"
              title.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Odometer Fraud:</strong> Tampering with mileage or
              undisclosed discrepancies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trade-In Failure:</strong> Failing to pay off your
              trade-in vehicle, resulting in late fees or negative credit for
              you.
            </li>

          <h3>Utah's "Lemon Law"</h3>
          <p>
            The <em>New Motor Vehicle Warranty Act</em> (Utah Code 13-20-1)
            protects buyers of new vehicles that have significant defects. To
            qualify, the defect must <strong>substantially impair</strong> the
            use, market value, or safety of the vehicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Do you have a claim?</strong> Generally, your vehicle may
            qualify if:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The dealer has attempted to repair the
              <strong>same defect 4 or more times</strong>; OR
            </li>
            <li>
              The vehicle has been out of service for repairs for a total of
              <strong>30 days or more</strong>.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <em
              >Note: Before filing a lawsuit, you are generally required to file
              a complaint with the Utah Consumer Protection Division and
              participate in the manufacturer's informal dispute resolution
              process.</em

          <h3>How We Can Help</h3>
          <p>
            If a dealer made you a promise, it should be in writing. If it
            wasn't written on the contract, they likely won't honor it. If you
            believe you have been the victim of auto fraud or have a Lemon Law
            claim, accurate records are your best weapon.
          </p>
          <h4>Consultation Policy</h4>
          <p>
            Unlike some other areas of practice,
            <strong
              >we do charge a consultation fee for all auto-related
              matters.</strong
            >
            This allows us to review your specific contracts, repair orders, and
            timeline to determine if you have a viable case under Utah law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please gather all your documents—including the sales contract,
            repair receipts, and any written communication with the
            dealer—before contacting our office.
