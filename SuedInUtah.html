        <p>
          Have you been served with a summons and complaint in Utah? Need a
          <br />
          qualified Utah consumer law attorney? Jon H. Rogers is here to help.

          <h3>The Urgency</h3>
          <h4 style="font-style: italic">
            I Have Received a Summons and Complaint -- What Do I Do?
          </h4>
          <p>
            This means you are being sued in Court. The Complaint contains the
            claims being made against you. The Summons is the notification to
            you that you are required to respond and provides information on
            where and how to respond to The Complaint.
            <br /><br />If you are sued in Utah and reside in Utah, you
            generally only have 21 days to file your response. If sued in Utah
            but you reside outside Utah, you typically have 30 days to file your
            response. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"
              >CAUTION:</span
            >
            You do not want to wait to the last minute to retain counsel to
            assist you. More time can allow more options, better preparation,
            and a better response.

          <h3>Defending the Case: Jurisdiction and Rules</h3>
          <p>
            If you have been sued in Utah but have had no contacts with Utah and
            have not agreed to be sued in Utah, you might be able to defend
            based upon lack of Jurisdiction. "The authority of the state to hale
            a nonresident into a state court hinges on the ability to establish
            personal jurisdiction." (ClearOne, Inc. v. Revolabs, Inc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            In preparing an Answer to a Complaint, you will want to read and
            clearly understand Rules 8-12 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.
            Rule 8(d) makes it clear that failure to
            <span style="font-style: italic">deny</span> claims or "averments"
            in a Complaint means that these undenied claims are
            <span style="font-style: italic">admitted</span>. This means that
            failing to deny essential claims can result in a Judgment being
            obtained against you.

          <h3>Get a Lawyer or Not?</h3>
          <p>
            I have a simple rule of thumb.
            <span style="font-style: italic">always</span> consult an attorney
            As Soon As Possible (ASAP) once you know you are being sued. Let's
            face it, even if the facts should be on your side, if the other side
            has an attorney or is more knowledgeable about legal proceedings,
            you will probably end up losing simply because you did not know the
            procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Utah Courts have loosened the restrictions on the "unbundling" of
            legal services. What this means is that you may be able to hire an
            attorney for a specific part of your case. With the advent of modern
            technology, retaining and communicating with your Utah attorney can
            almost be as easy as if Jon were down the street from your home or
            office.
