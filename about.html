          <p>
            Jon Rogers is a native of Salt Lake City who received his juris
            doctorate (law degree) from the Vanderbilt University School of Law
            in Nashville, Tennessee, a school consistently ranked among the top
            20 in the nation. Returning to Utah, he spent a year with a small
            firm in Layton doing mostly collections work.

            <br /><br />In the fall of 1994, Jon decided to focus his practice
            on consumer law. He began a solo practice in the building that once
            housed St. Mark's Hospital at 800 North on 300 West in Salt Lake
            City. Jon married shortly after opening his practice. He and his
            wife, Leslie, have four children.

            <br /><br />Over the years, numerous clients had inquired if Jon did
            estate planning, indicating that basic, affordable estate plans were
            hard to find. In 2010, Jon Rogers expanded his practice to include
            estate planning.

            <br /><br />Jon Rogers has bench and jury trial experience and
            regularly speaks to the community on consumer law and estate
            planning issues. Many of his referrals come from past clients and
            other attorneys (frequently including opposing counsel).
